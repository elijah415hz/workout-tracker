## Description
Workout Tracker allows you to easily track your workouts. Featuring a clean and intuitive design it allows you to easily add, edit, and delete workouts. All workouts are stored in a MongoDB database, so they'll be there whenever you need them. Workout Tracker makes use of dynamically generated HTML to improve the user experience by doing nearly all database requests behind the scenes, thus minimizing page reloads. The site is deployed at: https://eb-workout-tracker.herokuapp.com/
